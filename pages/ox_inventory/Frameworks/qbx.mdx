# Qbox Project

Qbox is a fork of QBCore being developed by a team of former contributors and developers on QBCore. The team is focused on improving performance and security, as well as converting resources to support our resources (mainly ox_lib and ox_inventory).

We _strongly_ advise using Qbox as an alternative to QBCore.

## Installation

- Setup [qbox](https://github.com/Qbox-project/qbx_core).
- Edit your `server.cfg`.
  - Add `setr inventory:framework "qbx"` before starting your resources.
  - Start ox_inventory immediately after qbx_core.
