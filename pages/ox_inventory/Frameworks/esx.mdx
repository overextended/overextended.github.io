# ESX

## Compatibility

Ox Inventory is a complete replacement for existing item, inventory, and weapon systems; it is inherently incompatible with ESX and any resources that rely on default behaviour.

- Loadouts do not exist and weapons are treated as items.
- Standard shops and stashes (i.e. esx_shops, esx_weaponshop, and esx_policejob).
- Resources that alter the default esx inventory or provide a ui (i.e. esx_trunkinventory, esx_inventoryhud).

## Installation

- Use a compatible version of [ESX Legacy](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx-legacy) (1.6.0+).
- Modify your `server.cfg`, starting ox_inventory immediately after es_extended.

```yaml
start oxmysql
start ox_lib
start es_extended
start qtarget
start ox_inventory
```

## Convert ESX inventory data

- Start the server and type `convertinventory esx` into the server console.
- Optionally, type `convertinventory esxproperty` into the server console.
- Restart the server once conversion is complete.

## Optional Optimisation

All item related functions from xPlayer, such as `xPlayer.getInventoryItem`, have been modified for compatibility purposes; however they are considered deprecated.

The reasoning is fairly simple - there's now additional function references and overhead to consider. Fortunately, the new Inventory functions can be used directly and offer a great deal of improvements over the old ones.

You should read through the functions section for further information, but the following should give you a decent idea.

<Tabs items={["ESX", "Ox Inventory"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```lua
    if xPlayer.getInventoryItem('acetone').count > 2 and xPlayer.getInventoryItem('antifreeze').count > 4 and xPlayer.getInventoryItem('sudo').count > 9 then
        xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("acetone", 3)
        xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("antifreeze", 5)
        xPlayer.removeInventoryItem("sudo", 10)
    end
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Add the following code somewhere in your resource to cache the exports metatable.

    ```lua
    local ox_inventory = exports.ox_inventory
    ```

    You will be able to reference any functions exposed through the export.

    ```lua
    local items = ox_inventory:Search(source, 'count', {'acetone', 'antifreeze', 'sudo'})
    if items and items.acetone > 2 and items.antifreeze > 4 and items.sudo > 9 then
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'acetone', 3)
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'antifreeze', 5)
        ox_inventory:RemoveItem(source, 'sudo', 10)
    end
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
