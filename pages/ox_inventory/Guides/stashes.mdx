# Custom Stashes

We can set up custom stashes from outside the resource utilising the exported RegisterStash function.

Firstly, we need to define the stashes properties.

## Stash properties

- id: `string`
  - Unique name to identify the stash in the database.
- label: `string`
  - Display name when viewing the stash.
- slots: `number`
  - Number of slots the stash will have.
- weight: `number`
  - Maximum weight of the stash inventory.
- owner?: `string` or `boolean`
  - `true`: Each player has their own unique stash, but can request to open the stash of another player
  - `false`: Only a single stash exists and is shared between all players
  - `string`: The stash explicitly belongs to the given owner, usually a player identifier
- groups?: `table`
  - Key-value pairs of job name and minimum grade to be able to access the stash. (`{["police"] = 0, ["ambulance"] = 2}`)
  - name: `string`
  - grade: `number`
- coords?: `vector3` or `table`
  - You can set the stash coordinates to prevent the stash from being opened if the player isn't close enough.
  - Vector or table containing the coordinates of the stash.

## Example

Below the value is hardset, but it could be loaded from the database (especially if there are unknown fields, i.e. owner)

```lua
-- Server
local stash = {
    id = '42wallabyway',
    label = '42 Wallaby Way',
    slots = 50,
    weight = 100000,
    owner = 'char1:license'
}

AddEventHandler('onServerResourceStart', function(resourceName)
    if resourceName == 'ox_inventory' or resourceName == GetCurrentResourceName() then
        exports.ox_inventory:RegisterStash(stash.id, stash.label, stash.slots, stash.weight, stash.owner)
    end
end)

-- Client
exports.ox_inventory:openInventory('stash', {id='42wallabyway', owner=property.owner})
```

The following sample is based on esx_property's db data.

```lua
-- Server
local properties

MySQL.query('SELECT * FROM `properties`', {}, function(result)
    properties = result
end

RegisterNetEvent('ox:loadStashes', function(id)
local stash = properties[id]
    if stash then
        -- id: 1, name: WhispymoundDrive, label: 2677 Whispymound Drive, coords: {"x":118.748,"y":566.573,"z":175.697}
        ox_inventory:RegisterStash(stash.name, stash.label, 50, 100000, true, false, json.encode(stash.room_menu))
    end
end)

-- Client
local ox_inventory = exports.ox_inventory

if ox_inventory:openInventory('stash', property.id) == false then
    TriggerServerEvent('ox:loadStashes')
    ox_inventory:openInventory('stash', property.id)
end
```

## Example Resource

We put together an example resource showcasing how to properly utilise the stash API:
