            metadata = { durability = 20 }
        },

- items: `table`
  - name: `string`
  - ingredients: `table`
    - Item ingredients can be seen in the item tooltip.
    - Key-value pairs of item name and consume count
      - key - Item name.
      - value - If 1 or above it's the consume count, if below 1 and above 0 it's the durability consume amount, if
        set to 0 then the item is required but not consumed.
  - duration: `number`
    - Crafting duration in milliseconds.
  - count: `number` or `table` (min, max)
    - Item amount received upon crafting.
    - If set it to table it requires two number first one is minimum number and second one is maximum, it will generate a random number between those two numbers to add the crafted item to player.
  - metadata: `table`
    - Metadata applied to the item being crafted.
- points: `vector3[]`
  - Interaction locations that will open the crafting inventory.
- groups: `table`
  - Key-value pairs of job name and minimum grade to access the crafting location.
  - `{["police"] = 0, ["ambulance"] = 2}`
- zones: `table`
  - ox_lib targeting zones used for ox_target.
  - coords: `vector3`
  - size: `vector3`
  - distance: `number`
  - rotation: `number`
- blip: `table`
  - id: `number`
    - Blip sprite number.
  - colour: `number`
  - scale: `number`
