# Creating Shops

Builtin shops are defined in [data/shops.lua](https://github.com/overextended/ox_inventory/blob/main/data/shops.lua), and more can be added here to benefit from the built-in markers or zones support.

## Shop definition

```lua
{
    General = {
        name = 'Shop',
        blip = {
          id = 59,
          colour = 69,
          scale = 0.8
        },
        inventory = {
            { name = 'burger', price = 10 },
            { name = 'water', price = 10 },
            { name = 'cola', price = 10 },
        },
        locations = {
            vec3(25.7, -1347.3, 29.49),
        },
        targets = {
            -- Shop using a BoxZone
            {
                loc = vec3(25.06, -1347.32, 29.5),
                length = 0.7,
                width = 0.5,
                heading = 0.0,
                minZ = 29.5,
                maxZ = 29.9,
                distance = 1.5
            },
            -- Shop using a ped
            {
                ped = `mp_m_shopkeep_01`,
                scenario = 'WORLD_HUMAN_AA_COFFEE',
                loc = vec3(24.407, -1347.283, 28.497),
                heading = 270.311,
            },
        }
    }
}
```

- name: `string`
  - The label to display when the shop is open.
- blip?: `table`
  - Creates a blip with the given settings. Leave it undefined for no blip to be created.
  - id: `number`
  - colour: `number`
  - scale: `number`
- groups?: `table`
  - Key-value pairs of job name and minimum grade to access the shop.
    - `{["police"] = 0, ["ambulance"] = 2}`
- inventory: `table`
  - name: `string`
  - price: `number`
  - currency?: `string`
    - Item to be used as currency.
  - count?: `number`
    - Amount of the item in the stock.
  - license?: `string`
    - License required to purchase the item.
  - metadata?: `table`
  - grade?: `number` | `number[]`
    - Grade required to purchase the item.
- locations?: `vector3[]`
  - An array of coordinates to create unique instances of the shop archetype at, using markers.
- targets?: `table[]`
  - An array of target settings to create unique instances of the shop archetype at, using peds or BoxZones (PolyZone data structure).
- model?: `number[]`
  - An array of models that can be targetted to open a shop. Used for vending machines.

Targets and model are only available when using a targeting resource like ox_target.

## Register during runtime

Shops can be added using `exports.ox_inventory:RegisterShop` on the server, however they cannot utilise any client-only features.

- Blips, markers, and zones will not be created.
- Must use "locations" and not "targets" to define each shop using the archetype.

### Example

```lua
exports.ox_inventory:RegisterShop('TestShop', {
    name = 'Test shop',
    inventory = {
        { name = 'burger', price = 10 },
        { name = 'water', price = 10 },
        { name = 'cola', price = 10 },
    },
    locations = {
        vec3(223.832962, -792.619751, 30.695190),
    },
    groups = {
        police = 0
    },
})
```
