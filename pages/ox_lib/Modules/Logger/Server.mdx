    To setup a grafana instance you'll need docker, and knowledge on containers or kubernetes.  
    Please find a guide to setup a grafana stack (min requirement grafana and grafana loki) and follow that.
    
    Once done, setup authentication and use the username and password securing your endpoint.

    - By default self-hosted loki instances do not provide any authentication layers and will require an external authentication layer such as NGINX basic auth or Cloudflare Access.

  set ox:logger "loki"
